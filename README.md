## SUMMARY

ConnectAid is a comprehensive web application designed to revolutionize charitable giving by 
creating a seamless bridge between generous donors and individuals requiring assistance. It
addresses the critical disconnect in community support systems where many individuals facing 
financial hardships, medical emergencies, or educational needs struggle to access appropriate 
resources or connect with willing donors, while potential donors often lack reliable mechanisms
to identify legitimate beneficiaries and track the impact of their contributions in Cameroon.
ConnectAid was developed using Next.js, for both frontend and backend development, integrated 
with a robust PostgreSQL database for secure data management and RESTful API architecture for 
efficient data communication. It has an interactive and intuitive UI/UX, in which donors can 
view all current and ongoing donation campaigns with advanced search and filtering mechanisms
that enable users to filter by multiple categories, keywords, and donation amounts. Also, donors
can track and see the impact of each donation they made and a grand total shown in the
dashboard. Again, donors can view details on each campaign ever donated and a receipt is
produced for each donation made. The application has 2FA implemented for security and
reduction of spam donor accounts. A user willing to donate can donate with out necessarily
registering and become a verified donor. In the case of seeker, a seeker submits the case for
donation physically or through a video call. Moreover, after each request submission, the
request must be verified and validated before it is uploaded to the ConnectAid web
application where users can view details and make donations. After the donation goal is
reached, the donations received is packaged and a dedicated team is tasked with taken the
AID back to the seeker and the ream ensure, the donation receives is used for the intended
purpose. Furthermore, the whole aid process is recorded with image and videos taken which
is later uploaded to the web application for transparency. The coding was done using VS
Code as the primary IDE, Next.js a React framework combined with Framer Motion for
engaging animations, Lucide React Icons and Font Awesome for icons, PostgreSQL for
database functionality, Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration, Vercel for
deployment Figma for intuitive UI design, and Lucid chart for UML diagrams to detailed the
system architecture.
